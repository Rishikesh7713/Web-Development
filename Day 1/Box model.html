        <p>A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working
        animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive/cute appearances,
        intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal)
        and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.</p>
