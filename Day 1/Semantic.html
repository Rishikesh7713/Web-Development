                <h3>A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working
                animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive/cute appearances,
                intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.</h3>
