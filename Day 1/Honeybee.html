<h3>What is a Honeybee?</h3>
        <p>A honey bee (also spelled honeybee) is a eusocial flying insect within the genus Apis of the bee clade, all native to
        mainland Afro-Eurasia. After bees spread naturally throughout Africa and Eurasia, humans became responsible for
        the current cosmopolitan distribution of honey bees, introducing multiple subspecies into South America (early 16th
        century), North America (early 17th century), and Australia (early 19th century).</p>
