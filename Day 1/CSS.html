        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p class="demo">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language designed to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
        
        It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents by prescribing colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.
        The main advantages are the separation of content (in HTML) and styling (in CSS) and the same CSS rules can be used
        across all pages and not have to be rewritten.
        HTML uses tags and CSS uses rule sets.
        CSS styles are applied to the HTML element using selectors.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="p1">CSS consists of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and applied to the corresponding elements. A style rule
        set includes a selector and a declaration block.
        
        Selector: Targets specific HTML elements to apply styles.
        Declaration: Combination of a property and its corresponding value</p>
